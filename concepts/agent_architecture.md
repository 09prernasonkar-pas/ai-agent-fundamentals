# Agent Architecture

An AI agent follows a structured lifecycle to achieve a goal.

## High-level Flow
1. Receive user goal
2. Understand intent using LLM
3. Decide next action
4. Use tools if required
5. Observe results
6. Store memory
7. Produce final output

## Why Architecture Matters
A well-defined architecture improves:
- Reliability
- Explainability
- Debugging
- Product scalability
